# Plant Data Visualization

This Python script visualizes plant data using scatter plots. It reads a CSV file containing information about plants, such as leaf color, oxygen production, and carbon dioxide usage, and creates scatter plots to analyze the relationships between these variables.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:

   - Make sure the plant data CSV file (`data.csv`) is present in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python plant_data_visualization.py
   ```

3. The script will generate two scatter plots:

   - Leaf Color vs. Oxygen Production: This plot visualizes the relationship between leaf color (represented as hexadecimal codes) and oxygen production.

   - Carbon Dioxide Used vs. Oxygen Production: This plot shows the relationship between carbon dioxide usage and oxygen production.

4. The plots will be displayed on your screen.

   - The Leaf Color vs. Oxygen Production plot uses different colors for different leaf colors, represented by the hexadecimal codes.
   - The Carbon Dioxide Used vs. Oxygen Production plot uses a blue color for all data points.

## Customization

- You can modify the code to adjust the plot size, axis labels, and titles according to your preferences.
- The script includes commented code to annotate each data point with its name, which can be enabled by uncommenting the relevant lines.
